## 🚀 Welcome to My Algorithmic Playground!

Hello there, fellow coders and curious minds! 👋 This repository is a living testament to my exciting journey through the world of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). Here, you'll find a growing collection of solutions to various problems, meticulously crafted using different data structures and algorithmic techniques as I explore and learn something new each day.

My aim is not just to solve problems, but to truly **understand** the underlying principles and master the art of efficient problem-solving. This repository serves as my personal DSA diary, where every commit reflects a new concept grasped, a new challenge conquered, and a new step forward in my coding adventure.

## 💡 What You'll Find Here

This repository is organized to make it easy for you to navigate and explore. You'll discover solutions categorized by:

* **Data Structures:** Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees (BSTs, Heaps, AVL, Red-Black - coming soon!), Graphs, Hash Maps, Stacks, Queues, Tries, and more! 📚
* **Algorithms:** Searching (Binary Search, Ternary Search), Sorting (Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort), Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithms, Backtracking, Divide and Conquer, Graph Traversal (BFS, DFS), and many others. 🧠
* **Problem Platforms:**
    * [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/u/Ajay_v44/) 🚀
    * [GeeksforGeeks (GFG)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/vajay06o4/) 📖
    * [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/YOUR_HACKERRANK_PROFILE/) 💻
    * ...and potentially more as I explore!

## 🔥 Getting Started (for you!)

Feel free to browse through the folders and explore the solutions. Each solution aims to be:

* **Clean and Readable:** Well-commented code for easy understanding. 🧹
* **Efficient:** Optimized for time and space complexity where possible. ⚡
* **Varied:** Showcasing different approaches to the same problem. 🎨

To run any of the solutions locally:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Ajay-v44/DSA_SOLUTIONS.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the problem folder:**
    ```bash
    cd DSA_SOLUTIONS/src
    ```
3.  **Compile and run (if applicable for your language):**
    *(Replace with specific instructions for your primary language, e.g., Python, C++, Java)*
    * **Python:** `python solution.py`
    * **C++:** `g++ solution.cpp -o solution && ./solution`
    * **Java:** `javac Solution.java && java Solution`
